# FineFeature-guidance
Code for our manuscript "Itâ€™s All in the Details: Guiding Fine-Feature Characteristics in Artificial Medical Images using Diffusion Models" (submitted for publication).

## Introduction

This repository contains the code to reproduce the results of our manuscript "Fine Feature guidance in artificial medical images using the DiFine model". The code is written in Python and uses the PyTorch library.

The DiFine model contains an autoencoder, a diffusion model with coarse feature guidance, and a classifier for fine feature guidance.

In the following, we will introduce the pre-request packages and the usage of the code.

## Prerequisites

The code is written in Python 3.7 and uses the following packages:

- PyTorch 1.7.1
- torchvision 0.8.2
- numpy 1.19.2
- pytorch-lightning 1.1.4

## Usage

The code is organized in the following way:

- `configs/`: contains the configuration file
  - `autoencoder/`: contains the configuration file for the autoencoder
  - `latent-diffusion/`: contains the configuration file for the diffusion model
  - `classifier/`: contains the configuration file for the classifier
- `data/`: contains the feature info files (.csv) for the datasets
  - `preprocessing/`: contains the files for preprocessing of the used datasets
- `logs/`: used to store the training logs, each of which is stored in a separate folder named by the current time
- `lsdm/`: includes all the code for the DiFine model
- `main.py`: contains the code to train and test the DiFine model

To simply test the training procedure of the DiFine model, you can run the following command (on BrainMRI dataset):

```bash
python main.py --base configs/latent-diffusion/lsdm_general-BrainMRI3.yaml -t --gpus 0,
```

For specific training settings, please follow the instructions in the jupyter notebook `05-training.ipynb`.

To test the DiFine model, use `01/02/03/04-*.ipynb` to load the trained model and test the performance:

- `01-generation-LIDC-IDRI.ipynb`: test the DiFine model on the LIDC-IDRI dataset and visualize the classifier guidance
- `02-generation-BreastMam.ipynb`: test the DiFine model on the BreastMam dataset
- `03-generation-BrainMRI.ipynb`: test the DiFine model on the BrainMRI dataset
- `04-manipulation-LIDC-IDRI.ipynb`: test the manipulation ability of the DiFine model on the LIDC-IDRI dataset

Remember to check and change the parameters high-lighted on the top of each cell.
